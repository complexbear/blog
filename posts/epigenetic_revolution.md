I found this book to be an easily accessible introduction into the mechanisms behind the variation in *behaviour* of our DNA. DNA is like the toolkit from which animals can develop all the necessary tissue types and molecular chemistry to function. Epigenetics is the levers and controls that select the (gene) tools and put them to use in the correct context and at the correct time.

I was amazed at how far reaching these effects are felt, from inheriting environmental adaptations that our parents experienced through to explaining how identical twins diverge in appearance as they age.

There are two core processes that can be used to alter the behaviour of a given gene on a chromosome. The result of which can be to increase or decrease the activity of a targeted gene. One process tends to be permanent (methylation of a CpG site) and the other is more temporary (histone proteins).

The former is used for example to label a particular chromosome as originating from the maternal or paternal germ line. This labelling turns out to be crucial for the normal development of offspring, despite us having 22 identically paired chromosomes, (ignoring X & Y sex chromosomes).

The latter process is used to temporarily adjust the activity of the genome in response to some external condition, e.g. a nutrient deficient environment. This is really important for the adaptability and robustness of a species. It would be less than ideal if we had to wait for the next generation to adapt to a famine.

What really boggles my brain is that we are all derived from a single cell, and all the complexity of our biology, brains, etc is catered for in our genome. All the cells in my body have been faithfully copied from that one original cell. Added to that are these dynamic processes that ensure the right bits of that DNA library are active in the right place at the right time **and** allow us to survive in a diverse set of environments **and** we can pass these environmental adaptations on to our children without them losing the ability to adapt themselves should their environments change. Wow.

Definitely one of the best science books I've read; an easy read but with plenty of depth.
