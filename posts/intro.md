So, welcome to my blog. Common to a lot of blogs, this is mostly for me and not for you. All is vanity as they say. If you find my wandering thoughts of interest, please comment or email me! Life in a vacuum is no fun (unless you're a space scientist).

On to the meat of this post...

I find myself at a career crossroads with the fortunate circumstance of not needing to immediately jump into a new job. This particular crossroads is lush and bountiful with an internet connection, so I plan to stay here while. General topics I plan on diving into are:

* DNA/Genomics
* Healthcare integration with technology
* System architectures
* Computer languages
* Psychology
* Philosophy

It's quite the spectrum and no doubt other subject will creep in as my interest wanders.

As some green haired suicidal 90's game characters would say, "Let's go!".
