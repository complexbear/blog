I read this book somewhere around 2005-ish, and it was an eye-opener to say the least. It got me thinking about the distinction between my biology and the "I" consciousness that inhabits that body. Having a clearer view of the limits of each and that to a degree I am at the mercy of my animal self was liberating.

The book starts from simple fundamental physics and gradually builds to describe how the physical brain & subconscious work to construct a model of the world that can be interpreted and used by the conscious self. Thus our view of reality is the "User Illusion" as presented by our brains.

Having a better understanding of how your subconscious is affected by environment, sleep and behaviours can help the individual take deliberate actions to mold and coerce the brain for the benefit of the person overall. For example, practising positive thoughts or meditation make it more likely that that will become your default state and thus in general a happier one! This is similar to cognitive behaviour therapy, but the nice this about the book is it explains how it all works. It's not just fluffy psychology magic.

After reading this book I found many more excellent resources to help improve "my" mental relationship with my body and brain. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_30JzRGDHI" target="_blank">In particular this talk which I also highly recommend.</a>
